## Description

Traffic congestion in Bandar Sunway has been a persistent issue, especially for students commuting to Sunway University. SunwayHoppers addresses this by providing a carpooling platform aimed at promoting sustainable transportation. This project focuses on reducing traffic and parking shortages by encouraging students to carpool, supporting Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) for sustainable cities.

The platform is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap 5, AJAX, JSON, and MySQL. It offers a user-friendly interface, secure data management, and a reward system where students earn redeemable digital vouchers for carpooling. This initiative aims to alleviate traffic while promoting a greener commuting culture among students.
